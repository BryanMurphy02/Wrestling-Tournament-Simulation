# Wrestling Tournament Simulation
##### Created By: Bryan Murphy
## Description
Simulation of 192 wrestlers competing in a tournament. Each wrestler waits in a line until they reach the front where they then place thier names in 1 of 6 piles. These piles are then broken up into 16 different teams. Each team then competes in a tournament and the last team standing wins. 
# 
## Running the Simulation
When running the simulation, the user will have two options. The user can either choose the fast method or the slow method. The fast method will run through the simulation immediately. The slow method will ask the user how many seconds they want to have as a buffer between each match. This means that the results of each match will be shown to the user, rather than only printing the winner of the entire tournament.
