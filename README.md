# Wrestling Simulation
#
## Description
Simulation of 192 wrestlers competing in a tournament. Each wrestler waits in a line until they reach the front where they then place thier names in 1 of 6 piles. These piles are then broken up into 16 different teams. Each team then competes in a tournament and the last team standing wins. The viewer can choose two options when running the simulation, fast and slow. The fast mode instantaneously runs the simulation and returns the winning team. The slow mode takes the viewer through each match in the tournament.
